Blog is completed. For now. Mentally exhausting weekend project with camping trip in the middle.
Jekyll has been great, tons of fun to use. Love the templating, and how markdown/html are intertwined.
Super dusty on my CSS since it's been a while, but we got there in the end. Decided on a little
Bootstrap plus some hacky styling. Still need to implement the navbar on mobile but I don't think
I have it in me right now. Coming soon I guess.

Big plans for this blog. Going to try and journal daily progress (although I'm telling myself that
every two days is fine, since sometimes there's not much to talk about). I have a few exciting
projects on the burner- namely [splinter](https://github.com/wg4568/splinter) which I will be
talking about in the near future.

For the most part my day-to-day consists of Chegg work and just general tinkering. I'm hoping this
blog can bring the bigger picture into focus a little better. I have some opportunities on the horizon
so I want to be ready for that. Also excited for collaboration with [luke](https://lam.blogliam.com/)
and henry (not linked (yet)) which we hoped this project would foster.
