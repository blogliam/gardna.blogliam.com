My DigitalOcean hosting costs have been growing--it seems like at the current rate of expansion I'll soon be paying upwards of $30 a month. So I decided to get ahead of it and buy myself a dedicated piece of hardware to host from. I picked up a Dell workstation (at least when it comes to appearance) on Craigslist for about $150.

It runs an Intel Core i3 6100 with 8GB of ram. It came with a 256GB ssd but it was so old that I had to upgrade to a more modern SSD I had kicking around--although half the capacity. It's not the greatest machine but it's more than capable of handling what I need it to do. It even came with a ZOTAC GT 710 graphics card which I uninstalled and will probably resell. I think it's worth somewhere in the range of $30-50.

_It has this cool little 3D printed backplate, I assume since the OEM wouldn't fit in the case_

After wiping it and installing Ubuntu Server, I managed to get blogliam.com up and running from the new host. I'm going to take this oppertunity to grow my sysadmin skills since I'm normally a little bit lazy when it comes to administration. I spent the evening reviewing my SSH keys, linux permissions and user management skills.

The server tucks nicely behind my monitors due to it's really small form factor. It suprised me just how tiny this thing is. Looking forwards, the next upgrade will be to install a 1TB NAS drive. Then maybe upgrade to 16GB of ram. Overall happy with the outcome of this project.
