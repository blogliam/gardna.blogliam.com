Played the piano properly for the first time in a year or so. At first I couldn't even figure out where to put my hands. Suprisingly after around 15 minutes I was able to fumble my way through old songs I used to play. It was fun, I think I'm going start dabbling with music again. I want to write songs like I used to.

Cool song on new Brockhampton album. It's nothing crazy but I enjoyed it a lot. I don't have the musical vocabulary to describe it properly, but I guess it's just sparse beats that use classical instruments (piano, violin, cello, etc). Always love that shit.

Oh also, I've noticed more and more artists using the AI image-transformation thing. It's really obvious in WHEN I BALL but Brockhampton also used it in BUZZCUT.

The first time I saw it in a music video was Take Care In Your Dreaming by the Avalanches. I've grown to really love the effect. I think I'm going to try and get a version of the software running locally. I'm _pretty_ sure it's [Ganbreeder](https://github.com/joel-simon/ganbreeder).

Ideas:

- Video game with "4D" element, time reflected as transformations in the world
- Terrain generator for 3D game, Minecraft plugin?
- Encode other mediums in the image, music etc.
- Generate music in transformation between two songs encoded as images
- Wallpaper generator. Wallpaper that changes (very slowly) over time

Here's that Avalanches video btw. Genuinely one of the most beautiful things I've seen in a while.
