The other day I bought a clock on eBay for $12. I made sure it ticked. It seems like clocks nowadays are all silent, hence why I ended up turning to second hand in order to find one that both a) made sound and b) looked nice. At the time, I considered the ticking to be a relaxing feature. Throughout childhood I always had a clock in my room, and I have strong memories of lying in bed counting the seconds as time ticked on.

When the clock arrived, it was normal enough. I grabbed a battery and set the time, not yet able to hang it since I was out of nails. That night when I slept I found that the ticking didn't relax me, but stressed me out. The past few years, I've found the passage of time--or the idea of wasting time--to be incredibly stressful. The ticking clock is a physical manifestation of that anxiety.

Eventually I did fall asleep, despite the seemingly harmless clock sitting flat on my desk. Over the next few days I thought about it often.

I came to the conclusion that in recent months I've been adrift. Sure I've been productive, but I'm disconnected from the idea of time. Weeks pass and I barely notice, I go from project to project, bug to bug and yet I feel stationary. The clock reminds me that's not the case.

I've come to embrace it. The first nights of anxiety have been replaced with, understanding? It's helped me center myself.
