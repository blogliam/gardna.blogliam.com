It's been a long time since I last made a blog post. Mostly due to the fact that I took up a full time job as a sailing instructor at [Shoreline Lake](https://shorelinelake.com/). It's a pretty good job, although the pay isn't great considering that it's probably the hardest I've ever worked. Either way, I consider the experience I've gained over the past few months as part of the payment. Once I stop learning it will be time to move on.

Throughout high school I found myself frequently involved in teaching. It's always been something I'm drawn to, but I never considered it an interest of mine until now. Education is a fascinating subject, and I believe it's something that gets little attention considering how vital it is that we can produce effective teachers.

For some perspective, I began teaching youth summer camps. These are typically 1 week (Mon-Fri) courses where campers spend 5-6 hours a day at the lake. The children range from ages 9-14 and would be seperated into classes of 10-15 based on age and experience level. As a sailing instructor, I specifically focus on the sailing portion of the summer camp (other activities are often included). As camps began to wind down for the year, I was switched over to the adult weekend classes. These are 8 hour courses (split between Sat/Sun) where students learn to sail from the ground up.

I've found that being a sailing instructor has ignited (or perhaps reignited) a passion for teaching. I'd like to document some of my experiences this summer in this blog post.

#### Fun is key

It's pretty apparent to most people that in order to engage children in learning, you need to make it fun. This is equally true for adults, however in my experience what is considered "fun" varies between age groups. In general, any form of game makes learning more enjoyable for everybody. The issue comes from the adult reservations to participating in games that they might consider "childish."

Take the rights of way game, for example. In this game students must remain in a patch of water marked with buoys, and use sailing right of way rules to avoid collision and force other boats out of the zone.
