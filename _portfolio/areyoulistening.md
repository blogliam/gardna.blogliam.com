[areyoulistening.studio](https://ayl.gardna.net) was a webstore that allowed for users to customize their own t-shirt to feature nine of their favorite albums. It featured an adaptive mobile and desktop site, Paypal integration, automatic email receipts and a host of backend tools used for order management. During the months that it was active, we sold over $1500 worth of shirts. Below are some screenshots from the website in various stages of development.
